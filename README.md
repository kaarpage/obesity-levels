# obesity-levels
The problem addressed consists to observe the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, with ages ranging from 14 to 61 years, based on their eating habits and physical conditions.
For data collection, an anonymous survey was carried out and, with this, it was possible to summarize the data in 17 attributes, namely:

- Genre
- Age
- Weight (in Kg)
- Height (in meters)
- Family with a history of obesity
- Frequent consumption of high-calorie foods (HCV)
- Frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC)
- Number of main meals (NCP)
- Food consumption between meals (CAEC)
- Daily water consumption (CH20)
- Alcohol consumption (CALC)
- Attributes related to physical condition:
– Calorie consumption monitoring (SCC)
– Frequency of physical activity (FAF)
– Time of use of technological devices (TUE) – Transport used (MTRANS)

At the end of the data tabulation, it was possible to establish a target class, named of NObesity, which classifies, based on the data obtained and the Mexican normativity the person's obesity level, which can be: Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. It is important to note that 77% of the data were generated synthetically while 23% of the data were collected directly from the users. This creation of synthetic data was necessary because only the data collected showed an unbalanced distribution regarding the category of obesity levels.
